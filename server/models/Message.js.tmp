const sequelize = require('../config/database'); // Assuming database config is here, wait, index.js usually inits sequelize. Let's check how other models do it.
// Actually in this project, it seems models are defined using `sequelize.define` often passed or required. 
// Let's check `User.js` to see the pattern.
